# Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
**Release Date:** 2025/09/12

## Overview
We are excited to announce the initial release of the Cribl-Microsoft integration repository! This release provides comprehensive automation tools and templates for integrating Cribl Stream with Azure Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel.

## Features

### DCR Automation (`Azure/CustomDeploymentTemplates/DCR-Automation/`)
- **PowerShell-based automation** for creating Azure Data Collection Rules
- **Dual mode support**: Direct DCRs (simple, cost-effective) and DCE-based DCRs (advanced routing)
- **Native table support** for SecurityEvent, Syslog, CommonSecurityLog, WindowsEvent, and more
- **Custom table support** with schema management for tables with `_CL` suffix
- **Automatic Cribl configuration export** to streamline destination setup
- **Template-only mode** for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Intelligent naming** with automatic abbreviation for Azure's 30-character limit
- **Dynamic schema retrieval** from Azure Log Analytics

### DCR Templates (`Azure/CustomDeploymentTemplates/DCR-Templates/`)
- **50 pre-built ARM templates** for Sentinel native tables
- **Two deployment modes**: 
 - Direct DCRs (`DataCollectionRules(NoDCE)/`)
 - DCE-based DCRs (`DataCollectionRules(DCE)/`)
- **Complete schema definitions** for all supported native tables
- **Ready-to-deploy** JSON templates for manual deployment

### Cribl Stream Integration
- **Automatic generation** of Cribl destination configurations
- **Support for Azure AD authentication** with service principal
- **Individual config files** for each DCR/table combination
- **Bulk configuration export** for enterprise deployments

## What's Included

### Core Scripts
- `Run-DCRAutomation.ps1` - Main entry point with simplified commands
- `Create-TableDCRs.ps1` - Core engine for DCR creation
- `Generate-CriblDestinations.ps1` - Cribl destination config generator

### Configuration Files
- `azure-parameters.json` - Azure resource configuration template
- `cribl-parameters.json` - Cribl naming conventions
- `operation-parameters.json` - Script behavior settings
- `NativeTableList.json` - Native tables configuration
- `CustomTableList.json` - Custom tables configuration

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README files at all levels
- Quick Start guide for rapid deployment
- Cribl destinations configuration guide
- Custom table schema documentation
- Contributors guide

## Supported Tables

### Native Tables
- Security tables (SecurityEvent, CommonSecurityLog, Syslog)
- Azure native tables (AzureActivity, AzureDiagnostics)
- Microsoft Defender tables (DeviceEvents, DeviceFileEvents)
- Cloud provider tables (AWS CloudTrail, GCP Audit Logs)
- ASIM normalized tables (Authentication, Network, DNS, Process events)
- Assessment & recommendation tables
- Update management tables

### Custom Tables
- Support for any custom table with `_CL` suffix
- Schema definition through JSON files
- Automatic table creation in Log Analytics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure `azure-parameters.json` with your Azure details
3. Run `.\Run-DCRAutomation.ps1` to see available commands
4. Deploy DCRs using automated scripts or manual templates

For detailed instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](../Azure/CustomDeploymentTemplates/DCR-Automation/QUICK_START.md).

## System Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Azure PowerShell modules
- Azure subscription with Log Analytics workspace
- Appropriate Azure RBAC permissions
- Cribl Stream instance (for integration features)

## Security Notes

- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Use Azure Key Vault for production deployments
- Follow least-privilege principles for service accounts
- Review all templates before deployment

## Known Limitations

- Direct DCRs limited to 30-character names
- DCE-based DCRs require additional Azure resources
- Custom tables must follow `_CL` naming convention
- Template size limitations for very large schemas (300+ columns)

## Acknowledgments

This initial release represents a comprehensive solution for organizations looking to integrate Cribl Stream with Azure Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel. The automation tools significantly reduce deployment time and complexity while maintaining flexibility for various use cases.

### Special Contributors

We extend our sincere gratitude to the following individuals whose contributions were instrumental in making this release possible:

- **Cam Borgal** - *Original DCR table specific templates creation* 
 Cam's foundational work on the Data Collection Rules (DCR) templates provided the essential framework that enabled streamlined data collection and processing capabilities. The original table-specific templates serve as the cornerstone for our automated deployment approach.

- **James Pederson** - *Direct DCR Templates and Automation script* 
 James's contributions to the Direct DCR templates and the development of comprehensive automation scripts have significantly improved efficiency and reduced manual configuration overhead. The PowerShell automation framework enables rapid deployment and consistent configuration across enterprise environments.
