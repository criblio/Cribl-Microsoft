## Known Limitations

### Basic SKU Limitations
- Maximum 10 Site-to-Site VPN tunnels
- Maximum aggregate throughput: 100 Mbps

- Advanced SKUs (VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3, AZ SKUs) planned for future release
- Does not include ExpressRoute integration
- Does not configure on-premises VPN device

## Usage

### Quick Start

.\Run-VPNSetup.ps1 -NonInteractive -Mode Full
```

### Prerequisites
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Azure PowerShell modules: Az.Network, Az.Resources
- Azure subscription with Network Contributor permissions
- Properly planned network address spaces

## Security Considerations

- Configuration files should not contain secrets
- Use Azure RBAC for access control
- Recommended to add azure-parameters.json to .gitignore
- VPN shared keys managed separately (not in this tool)

## Testing

This release has been tested with:
- Azure PowerShell Az module 10.0+
- PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.x
- Azure subscriptions in multiple regions (eastus, westus2)
- Fresh deployments and existing resource scenarios

## Bug Fixes

N/A - Initial release

## Performance
