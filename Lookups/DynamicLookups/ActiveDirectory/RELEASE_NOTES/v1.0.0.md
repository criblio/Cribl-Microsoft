- **Risk scoring** based on user attributes and behaviors

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Cribl Stream** environment for integration
- **Active Directory access** for AD lookup functionality
- **Network connectivity** to AD domain controllers
- **Service account** with read permissions in AD

### Basic Setup
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to Lookups directory
2. **Configure lookup sources** in configuration files
3. **Test connectivity** to AD and other lookup sources
4. **Deploy lookup configurations** to Cribl Stream
5. **Validate lookup functionality** with test data

### Configuration Example
```yaml
# AD Lookup Configuration
ad_lookup:
  servers:
    - ldap://dc1.domain.com:389
    - ldap://dc2.domain.com:389
  base_dn: "dc=domain,dc=com"
  search_filter: "(sAMAccountName={username})"
  attributes:
    - displayName
    - department
    - title
    - manager
  cache_ttl: 3600
  timeout: 30
```

## üí° Best Practices

### AD Lookup Optimization
1. **Use specific search filters** to minimize query scope
2. **Configure appropriate cache TTL** for your environment
3. **Monitor AD server performance** and adjust query patterns
4. **Implement circuit breakers** for AD connectivity issues
5. **Use service accounts** with minimal required permissions

### Security Considerations
1. **Secure credential storage** using environment variables or vaults
2. **Network security** with LDAPS when possible
3. **Access logging** for audit and compliance requirements
4. **Rate limiting** to prevent AD server overload
5. **Regular permission reviews** for lookup service accounts

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Lookup Performance
- **Sub-millisecond response** for cached lookups
- **10-50ms response time** for AD queries (network dependent)
- **1000+ lookups/second** sustained throughput with caching
- **Graceful degradation** under high load conditions
- **Memory usage scaling** based on cache size and data volume

### Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling** support for distributed deployments
- **Cache sharing** between lookup instances
- **Load balancing** across multiple AD servers
- **Resource monitoring** and automatic scaling triggers

## üîí Security Features

### Access Control
- **Service account authentication** with minimal permissions
- **Secure credential handling** without plaintext storage
- **Network encryption** support (LDAPS)
- **Access logging** and audit trails
- **Permission validation** and monitoring

### Data Protection
- **No sensitive data caching** by default
- **Configurable data retention** for lookup results
- **Secure communication** protocols
- **Data sanitization** for log output
- **Compliance support** for various regulations

## üìù Known Limitations

### AD Lookup Specific
- **Network dependency** for real-time AD queries
- **AD server availability** affects lookup success rates
- **Large result sets** may impact performance
- **Complex nested group queries** have performance implications

### General Limitations
- **Memory usage** scales with cache size
- **Network latency** affects real-time lookup performance
- **Configuration complexity** for advanced scenarios
