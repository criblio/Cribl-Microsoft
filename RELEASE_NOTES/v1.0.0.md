- **Intelligent naming** with automatic abbreviation for Azure's 30-character limit
- **Dynamic schema retrieval** from Azure Log Analytics

### DCR Templates (`Azure/CustomDeploymentTemplates/DCR-Templates/`)
- **50 pre-built ARM templates** for Sentinel native tables
- **Two deployment modes**: 
  - Direct DCRs (`DataCollectionRules(NoDCE)/`)
  - DCE-based DCRs (`DataCollectionRules(DCE)/`)
- **Complete schema definitions** for all supported native tables
- **Ready-to-deploy** JSON templates for manual deployment

### Cribl Stream Integration
- **Automatic generation** of Cribl destination configurations
